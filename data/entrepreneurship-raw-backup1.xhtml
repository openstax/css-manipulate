            <p id="m20053_delete_me">The flow of costs is generally the same for all costing systems. While the differences are in the details, product costs have material, labor, and overhead. In most production facilities, the raw materials are moved from the raw materials inventory into Work in Process (WIP) inventory. </p><section data-depth="1" id="m20053_eip-567"><h3 data-type="title">Work in Process Inventory</h3><p id="m20053_eip-320">
          The WIP involves one or more production departments and is where labor and overhead convert the raw materials into finished goods. When the product is sold, the costs move from Finished Goods Inventory into Cost of Goods Sold. <a href="#m20053_eip-id1171824961455" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> illustrates the flow of costs through production.

The best system to use depends on the product being manufactured. Each costing system also requires the ability to obtain and analyze the cost data and the more detailed the information needed, the higher the cost of collecting the data.<sup><a href="#m20053_rf-040101" id="m20053_rf-040101-og">1</a></sup>  The system used and the cost of collecting the data should not be greater than the benefit from having that information.</p><p id="m20053_eip-920">When products are custom ordered, knowing the cost of the material, labor, and overhead inputs is critical in determining the sales price. When products are mass produced and one batch leads to a second batch, stopping the process to properly identify the material, labor, and overhead costs used for each batch does not provide enough valuable data valuable to justify individual costing of each product. So different costing systems are used to determine the cost of the custom products and mass produced products.</p><p id="m20053_eip-334">Even retail companies need to know the cost of the purchased products before the sales price is set. While it seems simple to think of the sales price as the purchase price plus a markup; determining the markup costs needs to be an accurate process in order to ensure the sale price is higher than the cost of the product.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="m20053_eip-540"><h3 data-type="title">Costing Systems</h3><p id="m20053_eip-877">
          To properly capture the information necessary for decision making; there are different costing systems to <em data-effect="italics">track</em> costs in order to determine sales prices and measure profits and manufacturing efficiency.
          </p><p id="m20053_eip-101">There are two traditional types of costing systems: job order costing, and process costing used to anticipate or determine before year-end unit costs of products being manufactured and/or services being provided. Companies may decide to use only one or a combination of methods for their production costing. This chapter will explain job order costing and how it differs from process costing. Activity-based, variable, and absorption costing will be discussed in later chapters.</p><p id="m20053_eip-84">In this chapter, you will learn the similarities and differences of job order and process costing systems. You will also learn the terminology used in tracking costs within these two systems, and how to segregate and aggregate these costs to determine the costs of production in a job order costing environment. You will also learn how to record these job costs and where they appear on the financial statements.</p><p id="m20053_eip-562"><span data-type="term">Job order costing</span> (JOC) is used when individual products can be separately identified or when goods are made to order. The individual costs are easy to trace to the individual jobs and works well for companies such as: print service companies, advertising companies, building contractors, accounting services, consulting services, repair services, or movie production companies. </p><p id="m20053_eip-63"><span data-type="term">Process costing</span> is used when the manufacturing process is continuous, and it is difficult to establish how much of each material was used and exactly how much time was invested in each unit of finished product. With the process costing (PC) method, costs are accounted for by process or department and where it is difficult, if not impossible or not cost effective, to accurately measure the exact materials and labor in each individual product. This process works well for manufacturers of products such as golf balls, cereal, ice cream, gasoline, or paint. Process costing can also be used in the manufacturing of more complex items such as small engines, so it&#8217;s not limited to basic manufacturing activities. A PC system assigns costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit are calculated based on the information in the production departments.</p>

          <li>Debbie&#8217;s selling price on a gallon of milk is $3.00. She finds out that most local stores are charging $3.50. Based on this information, she decides to increase her price to $3.25. She has an employee put a new price sticker on each gallon.</li>
          <li>A customer buys a gallon of milk paying cash.</li>
          <li>The shelving is delivered with an invoice for $750.</li>

          <li>Debbie did not yet receive the shelving, it has only been ordered, so there is no asset yet. She also does not have a liability yet because she has not received the asset yet. Therefore, Debbie will not record the transaction.</li>
          <li>Changing prices does not have an impact on the company at the time the price is changed. All that happened was that a new price sticker was placed on the milk. Debbie still has all of the milk and has not received any money. </li>
          <li>Debbie now has a transaction to record. She has received cash and the customer has taken some of her inventory of milk. We have an increase in one asset (cash) and a decrease in another asset (inventory.)</li>
          <li>The asset has been delivered so Debbie has a new asset and must record the increase. She also has an increase in her liabilities as she accepted delivery of the shelving but has not paid for it.</li>

          </ol></div><p id="m20053_eip-470">Gains are similar to revenues in that both gains and revenues increase the value of the organization. The primary difference, however, between gains and revenues relates to the primary purpose of the organization. As an example, let&#8217;s return to the local coffee shop that you have been thinking about. You have already identified the activities that are considered revenues. Let&#8217;s say the coffee shop sells for cash the current espresso machine in order to purchase a new one. Let&#8217;s further assume the coffee shop sold the espresso machine for <em data-effect="italics">more</em> (highly unlikely) than it paid for the machine. Would the coffee shop be more valuable after this transaction than before it? Yes it would, because the coffee shop has more cash than it lost in value from the sale of the espresso machine. But how should the accountant classify this transaction? To call this revenue would technically be inaccurate because we know revenues are inflows related to the primary purpose of the business. In this case, revenues for the coffee shop relate to selling coffee and related items such as pastries and smoothies. In this transaction, the coffee shop receives cash so it is more valuable, but this should be considered a gain because the coffee shop was more valuable due to this incidental or peripheral transaction.</p>

          <p id="m20053_eip-id1171823792685">When money is borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, the loan is considered a personal or consumer loan. Typically, payments on these types of loans begin shortly after the funds are borrowed. Student loans are a special type of consumer borrowing that has a different structure for repayment of the debt. If you are not familiar with the special repayment arrangement for student loans, do a brief internet search to find out when student loan payments are expected to begin. </p><p id="m20053_eip-426">Now, assume a college student has two loans&#8212;one for a car and one for a student loan. Assume the person gets the flu, misses a week of work at their campus job, and does not get paid for the absence. Which loan would the person be most concerned about paying? Why?</p></div><p id="m20053_eip-761">Losses are similar to expenses in that both losses and expenses decrease the value of the organization. The primary difference, however, between losses and expenses again relates to the primary purpose of the organization. While expenses represent a decrease in organizational value from providing goods and services, losses represent a decrease in organizational value from activities that are &#8220;<em data-effect="italics">incidental</em> or <em data-effect="italics">peripheral</em>&#8221; (SFAC No. 6, p. 24) to the primary purpose of the business. Let&#8217;s return to our local coffee shop example. Now assume the coffee shop sold the espresso machine for less (a more likely scenario) than it paid for the machine. Would the coffee shop be less valuable after this transaction than before it? Yes it would, because the value of the coffee shop decreased by an amount greater than the cash it received. But how should the accountant classify this transaction? </p>

In this form, Roku disclosed its intention to become a &#8220;publicly-traded company,&#8221; meaning its stock will trade (sell) on public stock exchanges, allowing individual and institutional investors an opportunity to own a portion (shares) of the company. The Form S-1 included detailed financial and non-financial information about the company. The information from Roku also included the purpose of the offering as well as the intended uses of the funds. Here is a portion of the disclosure:
          <q id="m20053_eip-id1171824633343">The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock.

          On September 28, 2017, Roku &#8220;went public&#8221; and exceeded expectations. Prior to the IPO, Roku estimated it would sell between $12-$14 per share, raising over $117 million for the company. The closing price per share on September 28 was $23.50, nearly doubling initial expectations for the share value (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/history?p=ROKU).</p></div><p id="m20053_eip-623">KC notes that this paragraph has a few index term functionalities, such as not including the full term to reduce duplicate entries for singular and plural terms.

          Manufacturing companies have many similarities regardless of the costing method used, among them is the organizational chart and the flow of goods through production. The diagram in <a href="#m20053_eip-id1171824080496" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> below shows a partial organizational chart for Dinosaur Vinyl, a sign manufacturer. The CEO has several direct report units: Financing, Production, Information Technology, Marketing, Human Resources, and Maintenance. Each unit has a director responsible for several departments. The organizational chart also shows the departments that report to the production unit director and gives an indication as to the production arrangement. Raw materials are stored in the materials storeroom and delivered to the production department. The design department uses direct labor to create the design specifications and when completed, sends them to the production department. The production department uses the material and design specifications and adds even more labor to create the sign. The sign is transferred to the Finishing Department for final materials and labor before the sign is installed or delivered to the customer.

Overhead is also a cost of production and applied to each product based on an activity base discussed later in the chapter.

The Selling costs are the expenses related to promotion and sale of the company&#8217;s products and the administrative costs are the expenses related to the operations of the company. The S&amp;A costs are also called period costs because they include costs of departments not directly associated with manufacturing but necessary to operate the business.

Recall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the <em data-effect="italics">value</em> of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and services) <em data-effect="italics">increase</em> the value of the organization. So, every dollar of revenue an organization generates increases the overall value of the organization. Likewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) <em data-effect="italics">decrease</em> the value of the organization. So, each dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same approach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statemen </p><p id="m20053_eip-864">When money is borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, the loan is considered a personal or consumer loan. Typically, payments on these types of loans begin shortly after the funds are borrowed. Student loans are a special type of consumer borrowing that has a different structure for repayment of the debt. If you are not familiar with the special repayment arrangement for student loans, do a brief internet search to find out when student loan payments are expected to begin. </p><p id="m20053_eip-627">Now, assume a college student has two loans&#8212;one for a car and one for a student loan. Assume the person gets the flu, misses a week of work at their campus job, and does not get paid for the absence. Which loan would the person be most concerned about paying? Why?</p><p id="m20053_eip-622">If you review the list of the elements of the financial statements that we have examined thus far, you might notice that each of the elements is fairly controllable by the organization. For instance, if the organization wants to increase revenue, it might create a special advertising campaign to incentivize customers to purchase its goods and services. Likewise, the organization can decide the optimal level of assets required to efficiently and effectively operate the business and make adjustments accordingly. </p><p id="m20053_eip-160">A primary reason for separating the costs of production from the other expenses of the company is the <span data-type="term">expense recognition principle</span>. This principle requires the costs to be expensed when they match the revenue being earned; and separating the costs of production from the other costs results in the proper timing recognition of expenses. Period costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred and this policy matches administrative and other expenses shown on the income statement in the same period in which the company earns income. Separating the production costs and assigning them to the product results in the costs of the product staying with the inventory. If the products are not sold, the costs remain in ending inventory. When the products are sold, the cost of the inventory becomes the cost of goods sold and is expensed on the income statement.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="m20053_eip-885"><h4 data-type="title">Let's Make Some Lists</h4><p id="m20053_eip-44">Here is a bulleted list:</p><ul id="m20053_eip-573"><li>Here is the first bulleted item. </li>

This is normal, especially in the early stages of the process. You may want to start with an outline, and then fill in the details later. Or set aside a short time each day that you can spend on this task, so you train your mind to think about the vision you are setting for yourself. If you experience a mental block, try changing your environment &#8211; go outside, try a different time of day or go to a setting that is like the business you are interested in creating. Each of these strategies can help you get the creative juices flowing. You might also consider talking with someone who has experience in the field, to give you pointers and suggestions. Or better yet, find a mentor in your chosen area of interest, and keep this person apprised of your progress. Having someone to bounce ideas off of is a great asset to have when imagining the possibilities of the future. </p><table id="m20053_eip-74" class="text-heavy" summary="Alt text placeholder."><caption><span data-type="title">Financial Accounting versus Managerial Accounting set in Text-Heavy Table Style</span>This table is set as the &#8220;Text-Heavy Style&#8221; table from the basic table types being used for the non-accounting books in the business series, as outlined in the document &#8220;Business (no Accounting) Table Styles Specs&#8221; from OSX.</caption><thead>

          Process Costing is the optimal system when the production process is continuous and it is difficult to trace a particular input cost with a specific individual product. Process costing systems assign costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit is calculated based on the information from the production departments. The focus of process costing systems is on measuring and assigning the conversion costs to the proper department so the cost of the individual units can be determined.

                The expense recognition principle has the expenses follow the revenue. Product costs are assigned to the product because they are associated with the revenue from the sale of the product. The cost is transferred from inventory to cost of goods sold when the item is sold. This matches the revenue from the sale with the cost of the item being sold. Period costs are expensed when incurred because they are not related to a specific product and related to the time period in which revenue is earned.
