          <p id="m19998_eip-16">In 2015, Doug Monahan, CEO and Founder of iBackPack of Texas, Inc. introduced a revolutionary new technology all encased in a typical backpack. The iBackPack boasted capabilities to incorporate WiFi/MiFi, a 20,000 main battery system, smart power transfer cables, and a car-charging system in addition to the ability to carry four notebook computers and the related accessories. Monahan promised it would deliver a “communication hub and corresponding electrical powerhouse for students and business professionals alike.”<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="m19998_footnote-ref1"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#m19998_footnote1">1</a></sup>

An additional $76,694 was raised from 252 backers through Kickstarter. By 2017, years since its start, the iBackPack crowdfunding campaign that began with great promise failed to deliver the product promised to its investors.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="m19998_footnote-ref2"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#m19998_footnote2">2</a></sup><sup data-type="footnote-number" id="m19998_footnote-ref3"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#m19998_footnote3">3</a></sup>  Fast forward to 2016.<sup data-type="footnote-number" id="m19998_footnote-ref4"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#m19998_footnote4">4</a></sup><sup data-type="footnote-number" id="m19998_footnote-ref5"><a data-type="footnote-link" href="#m19998_footnote5">5</a></sup> KC notes that this opener is 300 words.

            <p id="m20053_delete_me">The flow of costs is generally the same for all costing systems. While the differences are in the details, product costs have material, labor, and overhead.

          The WIP involves one or more production departments and is where labor and overhead convert the raw materials into finished goods.

Each costing system also requires the ability to obtain and analyze the cost data and the more detailed the information needed, the higher the cost of collecting the data.<sup><a href="#m20053_rf-040101" id="m20053_rf-040101-og">1</a></sup>  The system used and the cost of collecting the data should not be greater than the benefit from having that information.</p><p id="m20053_eip-920">When products are custom ordered, knowing the cost of the material, labor, and overhead inputs is critical in determining the sales price. When products are mass produced and one batch leads to a second batch, stopping the process to properly identify the material, labor, and overhead costs used for each batch does not provide enough valuable data valuable to justify individual costing of each product. So different costing systems are used to determine the cost of the custom products and mass produced products.</p><p id="m20053_eip-334">Even retail companies need to know the cost of the purchased products before the sales price is set.

The individual costs are easy to trace to the individual jobs and works well for companies such as: print service companies, advertising companies, building contractors, accounting services, consulting services, repair services, or movie production companies. </p><p id="m20053_eip-63"><span data-type="term">Process costing</span> is used when the manufacturing process is continuous, and it is difficult to establish how much of each material was used and exactly how much time was invested in each unit of finished product. With the process costing (PC) method, costs are accounted for by process or department and where it is difficult, if not impossible or not cost effective, to accurately measure the exact materials and labor in each individual product. This process works well for manufacturers of products such as golf balls, cereal, ice cream, gasoline, or paint. Process costing can also be used in the manufacturing of more complex items such as small engines, so it’s not limited to basic manufacturing activities. A PC system assigns costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit are calculated based on the information in the production departments.</p>

The primary difference, however, between gains and revenues relates to the primary purpose of the organization. As an example, let’s return to the local coffee shop that you have been thinking about. You have already identified the activities that are considered revenues. Let’s say the coffee shop sells for cash the current espresso machine in order to purchase a new one. Let’s further assume the coffee shop sold the espresso machine for <em data-effect="italics">more</em> (highly unlikely) than it paid for the machine. Would the coffee shop be more valuable after this transaction than before it? Yes it would, because the coffee shop has more cash than it lost in value from the sale of the espresso machine. But how should the accountant classify this transaction? To call this revenue would technically be inaccurate because we know revenues are inflows related to the primary purpose of the business. In this case, revenues for the coffee shop relate to selling coffee and related items such as pastries and smoothies. In this transaction, the coffee shop receives cash so it is more valuable, but this should be considered a gain because the coffee shop was more valuable due to this incidental or peripheral transaction.</p>

          <p id="m20053_eip-id1171823792685">When money is borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, the loan is considered a personal or consumer loan. Typically, payments on these types of loans begin shortly after the funds are borrowed. Student loans are a special type of consumer borrowing that has a different structure for repayment of the debt. If you are not familiar with the special repayment arrangement for student loans, do a brief internet search to find out when student loan payments are expected to begin. </p><p id="m20053_eip-426">Now, assume a college student has two loans—one for a car and one for a student loan.

The primary difference, however, between losses and expenses again relates to the primary purpose of the organization. While expenses represent a decrease in organizational value from providing goods and services, losses represent a decrease in organizational value from activities that are “<em data-effect="italics">incidental</em> or <em data-effect="italics">peripheral</em>” (SFAC No. 6, p. 24) to the primary purpose of the business. Let’s return to our local coffee shop example. Now assume the coffee shop sold the espresso machine for less (a more likely scenario) than it paid for the machine. Would the coffee shop be less valuable after this transaction than before it? Yes it would, because the value of the coffee shop decreased by an amount greater than the cash it received.

          Manufacturing companies have many similarities regardless of the costing method used, among them is the organizational chart and the flow of goods through production. The diagram in <a href="#m20053_eip-id1171824080496" class="autogenerated-content">Figure 1.20</a> below shows a partial organizational chart for Dinosaur Vinyl, a sign manufacturer. The CEO has several direct report units: Financing, Production, Information Technology, Marketing, Human Resources, and Maintenance. Each unit has a director responsible for several departments. The organizational chart also shows the departments that report to the production unit director and gives an indication as to the production arrangement. Raw materials are stored in the materials storeroom and delivered to the production department. The design department uses direct labor to create the design specifications and when completed, sends them to the production department. The production department uses the material and design specifications and adds even more labor to create the sign. The sign is transferred to the Finishing Department for final materials and labor before the sign is installed or delivered to the customer.

Recall that we defined equity as the net worth of an organization. It is helpful to also think of net worth as the <em data-effect="italics">value</em> of the organization. Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and services) <em data-effect="italics">increase</em> the value of the organization. So, every dollar of revenue an organization generates increases the overall value of the organization. Likewise, expenses (outflows as a result of generating revenue) <em data-effect="italics">decrease</em> the value of the organization. So, each dollar of expenses an organization incurs decreases the overall value of the organization. The same approach can be taken with the other elements of the financial statemen </p><p id="m20053_eip-864">When money is borrowed from a bank or other lending institution, the loan is considered a personal or consumer loan. Typically, payments on these types of loans begin shortly after the funds are borrowed. Student loans are a special type of consumer borrowing that has a different structure for repayment of the debt. If you are not familiar with the special repayment arrangement for student loans, do a brief internet search to find out when student loan payments are expected to begin. </p><p id="m20053_eip-627">Now, assume a college student has two loans—one for a car and one for a student loan. Assume the person gets the flu, misses a week of work at their campus job, and does not get paid for the absence. Which loan would the person be most concerned about paying? Why?</p><p id="m20053_eip-622">If you review the list of the elements of the financial statements that we have examined thus far, you might notice that each of the elements is fairly controllable by the organization. For instance, if the organization wants to increase revenue, it might create a special advertising campaign to incentivize customers to purchase its goods and services. Likewise, the organization can decide the optimal level of assets required to efficiently and effectively operate the business and make adjustments accordingly. </p><p id="m20053_eip-160">A primary reason for separating the costs of production from the other expenses of the company is the <span data-type="term">expense recognition principle</span>. This principle requires the costs to be expensed when they match the revenue being earned; and separating the costs of production from the other costs results in the proper timing recognition of expenses. Period costs are expensed during the period in which they are incurred and this policy matches administrative and other expenses shown on the income statement in the same period in which the company earns income. Separating the production costs and assigning them to the product results in the costs of the product staying with the inventory. If the products are not sold, the costs remain in ending inventory. When the products are sold, the cost of the inventory becomes the cost of goods sold and is expensed on the income statement.</p></section><section data-depth="2" id="m20053_eip-885"><h5 data-type="title">Let&#39;s Make Some Lists</h5><p id="m20053_eip-44">Here is a bulleted list:</p><ul id="m20053_eip-573"><li>Here is the first bulleted item. </li>

This is normal, especially in the early stages of the process. You may want to start with an outline, and then fill in the details later. Or set aside a short time each day that you can spend on this task, so you train your mind to think about the vision you are setting for yourself. If you experience a mental block, try changing your environment – go outside, try a different time of day or go to a setting that is like the business you are interested in creating. Each of these strategies can help you get the creative juices flowing. You might also consider talking with someone who has experience in the field, to give you pointers and suggestions. Or better yet, find a mentor in your chosen area of interest, and keep this person apprised of your progress. Having someone to bounce ideas off of is a great asset to have when imagining the possibilities of the future. </p><table id="m20053_eip-74" class="text-heavy -css-plus-autogen-261 -css-plus-autogen-262 -css-plus-autogen-263 -css-plus-autogen-264 -css-plus-autogen-265 -css-plus-autogen-266 -css-plus-autogen-267 -css-plus-autogen-268" summary="Alt text placeholder."><caption class="-css-plus-autogen-281 -css-plus-autogen-282"><span data-pseudo="before(1)" class="-css-plus-autogen-269 -css-plus-autogen-270 -css-plus-autogen-271 -css-plus-autogen-272 -css-plus-autogen-273 -css-plus-autogen-274 -css-plus-autogen-275 -css-plus-autogen-276">Table 1.9</span><span data-pseudo="inside(1)" class="-css-plus-autogen-277 -css-plus-autogen-278 -css-plus-autogen-279 -css-plus-autogen-280"><span data-type="title" class="-css-plus-autogen-283 -css-plus-autogen-284 -css-plus-autogen-285">Financial Accounting versus Managerial Accounting set in Text-Heavy Table Style</span>This table is set as the “Text-Heavy Style” table from the basic table types being used for the non-accounting books in the business series, as outlined in the document “Business (no Accounting) Table Styles Specs” from OSX.</span></caption><thead class="-css-plus-autogen-286 -css-plus-autogen-287">

          Process Costing is the optimal system when the production process is continuous and it is difficult to trace a particular input cost with a specific individual product. Process costing systems assign costs to each department as the costs are incurred. The costs to produce one unit is calculated based on the information from the production departments. The focus of process costing systems is on measuring and assigning the conversion costs to the proper department so the cost of the individual units can be determined.

This is only a generalization since there are some service industries that do not have direct material, and there are some automated manufacturing companies that do not have direct labor.</p><p id="m20054_eip-805">To illustrate the components of product costs in a job order costing system, consider that Mac’s &amp; Cheese restaurant hires Dinosaur Vinyl, Inc. (DV) to manufacture the sign by the stadium. In the sign manufacturing process, materials are moved from raw materials inventory to the Production Department where the sign is printed.  When printing is complete, the sign is moved to the Finishing Department where more material is added to frame the sign before it is transferred to the Finished Goods Department.  The costs are tracked and move at the same time as the actual sign.  When Mac’s &amp; Cheese has completed its production contract and the sale is complete; the costs are moved to Cost of Goods Sold.

          <span data-type="term">Direct materials</span> are the materials that can be directly traced to the product.  A company needs inventory on hand to help customers quickly so there is usually some inventory on hand in the raw materials inventory account.  The material is sent to the production department when the material will be put into production.
          </p><p id="m20054_eip-45">A benefit of knowing the production costs for each job in a job order costing is the ability to set appropriate sales prices.  This system relies on maintaining accurate records and requires an information system that supports accurate documentation.  When the material is requested for production, a materials requisition slip is completed and shows the exact items and quantity requested along with the associated cost.  The completed form is signed by the requestor and approved by the manager responsible for the budget. </p>

Nails are often used in furniture production; however, one chair may need 15 nails while another needs 18 nails. At a cost of less than one cent per nail, it is not worth keeping track of each nail.  It is much more practical to track how many pounds of nails were used for the period and allocate this cost (along with other costs) to the overhead costs of the products finished.</p></section><section data-depth="1" id="m20054_eip-465"><h4 data-type="title">Indirect Labor</h4><p id="m20054_eip-303">

If the employee’s work can be directly tied to the product, it is direct labor.  If it is tied to the factory but not to the product, it is indirect labor.

          <p id="m20054_eip-id1165000241303">What does it take to manufacture the sign outside the stadium? It starts with the production department requisitioning vinyl and ink from the raw materials inventory.  Once the raw materials are delivered to the production department, the product is considered work-in-process inventory. There, <span data-type="term" class="no-emphasis">direct labor</span> is used to place the material into the printer, align the computerized design, and have it printed on the vinyl.  The direct materials and direct labor are known and recorded on the job order cost sheet. When the Production Department has completed its work, the sign and the job order cost sheet are transferred to the Finishing Department.  This department requests wood for framing and grommets for attaching the sign from raw materials inventory.  This department adds direct labor, wood, and grommets to the already printed sign to finish it properly.  </p><p id="m20054_eip-683">For the Production department, indirect material are the clips used to hold the material in place, indirect labor is the labor used to maintain the printer, and the electricity used to print is manufacturing overhead. In the Finishing Department, indirect material are glue and nails, while indirect labor is the labor of the individuals who maintain the construction materials. Indirect material, indirect labor, and overhead are added to the cost of the sign as manufacturing overhead through a process we will discuss later in the chapter.  The sign is now complete and the manufacturer knows the cost of the sign including all of the components: material, labor, and overhead.</p><p id="m20054_eip-751">The total manufacturing cost of any product is the total of materials, labor, and overhead.

Recall, too, that revenues (inflows as a result of providing goods and services) <em data-effect="italics">increase</em> the value of the organization.

This way of thinking can energize and motivate the entrepreneur to take their business to the next level. It is a learned behavior that can be adopted by any business founder who wants to continually improve their business. In the same way, entrepreneurial spirit is a key part of the start-up business. This is a forward thinking, problem solving, can-do approach to running the business. These two aspects of the business are reinforced by the entrepreneur’s passion. This internal drive will keep the individual going when things get tough, because their passion will carry them on to the next thing. Passion sustains the entrepreneur because it speaks to the core of what they do and why they do it.</p></section>

While the product is in production, the direct material and direct labor costs assigned so far are included in work in progress inventory. The direct material is requested by the production department and the direct material cost is directly attached to each individual job as the materials are released from raw materials inventory. The cost of direct labor is recorded by the employees and assigned to each individual job. </p><p id="m20055_eip-782">When the allocation base is known, usually when the product is completed, the overhead is allocated to the product on the basis of the predetermined overhead rate.

          When the job is completed, the total cost of the job: the direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead are totaled and transferred to finished goods at the same time the physical product is transferred.

Some of these business start-ups are the result of collaborative efforts of multi-disciplinary teams, where individuals from different disciplines come together to create items that they could not have created alone. We have also looked at the global nature of entrepreneurship, and the increasing diversity among entrepreneurs.

          In this section we have learned about creative ways to produce an entrepreneurial vision. There are many different methods that can work, and you should choose the one that best suits your situation. If that method is not productive, of course you should try another. Remember, entrepreneurial visions are not made overnight, but with time and effort, you will refine your vision to best match your entrepreneurial goals and objectives.

                The expense recognition principle has the expenses follow the revenue. Product costs are assigned to the product because they are associated with the revenue from the sale of the product. The cost is transferred from inventory to cost of goods sold when the item is sold. This matches the revenue from the sale with the cost of the item being sold. Period costs are expensed when incurred because they are not related to a specific product and related to the time period in which revenue is earned.

                Yes. A company may use both to account for different types of products. For example; a jewelry manufacturer may manufacture many of the same charms and use process costing. It may also have custom ordered jewelry and use job order costing.
